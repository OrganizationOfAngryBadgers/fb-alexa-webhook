Our wide-range of programs and resources are a direct result of answering the call of student needs on campus. Our retail operations like Geared Up, the Stand Stores, and Campus Print are affordable, student-centred options which generate profits to put right back into your student services. Whether it’s Advocacy services helping you resolve academic and personal issues, a fun and free Crash Course Cooking class, or the Uconnect Centre where Peer Tutoring and the Health & Dental Plan can be accessed, the BCIT Student Association has been here to represent the voice and needs of students at BCIT.\n\nWith this strong range of resources already in place, the Student Association has most recently been able to fill an even greater need for students. Most of you enrolled at BCIT because you want a job and are willing to do what it takes to make that happen, and the BCIT Student Association is committed to helping you achieve that goal. We know that proper career development skills are an essential part of the BCIT experience as they give students an edge when seeking employment; that is why the BCIT Student Association opened the BCITSA Career Services in 2014. The service has been a huge success in its infant year by hosting 2 career fairs (that connected students directly with employers), as well as employer information sessions, a new careers website with job postings and other useful information, careers-related workshops, and one-on-one sessions with students. All of this for only $12.50/student/term\n\nThis March 20 – 27 a referendum is being held to introduce plans to expand services by adding additional resources that will give BCIT students the tools they need to succeed in the future. The plan includes creation of the Student Development Centre and renovations to Professor Mugs Pub to name a couple (see below for a more detailed list). Did we mention that part time students will benefit from this referendum? Check out the FAQ for details.\n\nWe are asking that you vote “YES” to this plan so the BCITSA can continue enhancing student life. \n\nMore information is available at http://www.bcitsa.ca/referendum/\n\nPlease VOTE on your my.bcit.ca from March 20th -27th","end_time":"2015-03-27T12:00:00-0700","name":"BCITSA 2015 Referendum","place":{"name":"BCITSA","location":{"city":"Burnaby","country":"Canada","latitude":49.251290888603,"longitude":-123.00204802783,"state":"BC","street":"3700 Willingdon Avenue","zip":"V5G 3H2"},"id":"117426018300111"},"start_time":"2015-03-20T09:00:00-0700","id":"1547733478835496"},{"description":"Back by ridiculously popular demand the BCIT Student Association proudly presents its legendary LAN PARTY on March 6th!

Arm yourself with knowledge and education, and help us fight the stigma of mental illness. Let’s talk about it, and let’s work together to show our support to those in the BCIT community and beyond who live with mental illness every day.\nThis year, we’re focusing on 5 ways to improve mental health, and will celebrate each of these themes on a different day of the week:\n1 - Health and Fitness (Monday) \n2 – Relaxation (Tuesday) -Zen Lounge\n3 – Education (Wednesday)\n4 – Playing (Thursday)\n5 – Giving Back (Friday) - Doggie De-Stree\n\nMonday:\nTake care of your body, and your mind will follow! Exercise has been known to ease the symptoms of depression and anxiety, and it does this by releasing endorphins, the brain’s feel-good chemicals. Everyone likes feel-good chemicals! And exercise doesn’t have to be boring or take hours out of your day. Just 20 minutes of cardio exercise 3 times a week can improve your mood (not to mention your love handles). On Monday, Feb 17th, come join us in the great Hall (SE2) to learn more about the positive impact that health and fitness can have on your mood and your mind. Spin the wheel to win some awesome prizes, and enter to win the draw for your very own unicycle! There will also be demonstrations by the VanUni unicycle club, and the East Van Pillow Fight Club, Stressbusters is back by popular demand (12:30 in Town Square C), and there’s FREE yoga from 11:30 – 12:20 in the Mind Body Room in SE 16 (mats will be provided). Sign up is required for Stressbusters, and yoga and you can find the sign-up sheets in the Uconnect (SE2)\nWe'll also have a nap room for all you tired students needing extra rest: Feb 18th from 10 – 2 in Council Chambers SE2\n\nTuesday:\nDon’t forget to breathe! It’s so easy to get caught up in the daily grind of school, work, and life, and sometimes we forget that simply stopping and taking a moment to breathe can help calm us, and allow some time to process our thoughts. Maybe you think that meditation and yoga are too far out there for you, but keep in mind that breathing is what’s keeping you alive. Right now. So, think about it! On Tuesday, Feb 18th, swing by the Great Hall to experience our always-popular Zen Lounge, or take a few minutes to get some beautiful Henna work done. At 12:30 in Town Square C, Judy Bushnell from BCIT’s Counselling and Student Development will be hosting her powerful and effective Mindfulness Forum, and if you’re looking for calmness, you won’t want to miss it. Sign up is required for the Mindfulness Forum, and you can find the sign-up sheet in the Uconnect (SE2)\n\nWednesday:\nGI Joe was right; knowing is half the battle! When it comes to mental illness, ignorance isn’t bliss, it can be downright dangerous. The more you understand something, the better you are at learning to deal with it. Whether you or someone you love has a mental illness, the best way to learn coping strategies is to know what you’re up against. Come to the Great Hall on Wednesday, Feb 19th to chat with the knowledgeable participants in our resource fair. Reduce the stigma, discard your misinformation, and learn the truth about mental illness. We’ll also be running Zen Lounge again today, and at 1pm in Town Square C, Heather Hyde from the BCIT Counselling and Student Development will be giving her popular and informative presentation Unmasking Distress. Sign up is required for Unmasking Distress, and you can find the sign-up sheet in the Uconnect (SE2)\n\nThursday:\nIn 2013 a study was conducted of 30,000 students from 34 post-secondary institutions across Canada, and what they found was both sad and shocking.  89% of students are overwhelmed, 54% feel hopeless,\n64% said that they were lonely, 87% are exhausted, 56% experience overwhelming anxiety, and a full 10% have seriously contemplated suicide. Being a student ain’t easy! And that’s why we’re giving you a chance to NOT be a student for a few hours. Come by the great Hall on Thursday, Feb 20th and allow yourself to be a kid-for-a-day. You need the opportunity to play and to remind yourself that in times of stress, letting go and having fun can bring you back to life. No matter who you are, no matter how old you are, you’re always entitled to have fun. Live a little! It’s why we’re here.\n\n\nFriday:\nThere’s no doubt about it, people who volunteer have lower levels of depression, increased life satisfaction, and enhanced well-being (so says a 2013 study, anyway!) Volunteering is also a great way to meet new people, and it certainly opens up your networking opportunities, so giving back and paying to forward is beneficial to everyone! But who has the time, right? You do. Even an hour or two a week can make a big difference to any organization, and truly if you have a passion for something, there’s a way to volunteer to do it. On Friday, February 21st, come to the Great Hall in SE2 to meet some outside-the-box organizations that would be grateful for your help. And as an added bonus, we’ll have our famous Doggy De-Stress at the same time! Come on by, pet a puppy, and learn about some great volunteer opportunities that are out there waiting for someone just like YOU.","end_time":"2014-02-21T15:00:00-0800","name":"Speak Up Speak Out 2014","place":{"name":"BCIT Great Hall (SE2)"},"start_time":"2014-02-17T10:00:00-0800","id":"718289711523000"},{"description":"TWO DAY CELEBRATION OF VALENTINE’S DAY Feb 13 & 14\n\nYou're invited to come share some love in the Great Hall for our annual Lovefest!

After claiming that he was \"fighting feminism\", he shot all nine women in the room, killing six. He then moved through corridors, the cafeteria, and another classroom, specifically targeting women to shoot, before finally turning the gun on himself.\n\nOn December 6th, 2013 The BCIT Student Association will once again recognize Canada’s National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women. On that day, each of the five BCIT campuses will display a memorial to the 14 women who lost their lives at l’École Polytechnique de Montréal on December 6th, 1989 when that gunman, armed with a semi-automatic weapon, shot 24 people, leaving 4 men and 14 women dead. His suicide note blamed feminists for ruining his life.\n\nIn response to the massacre at l’École Polytechnique, the Canadian Parliament established The National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women in 1991. Intended as a call to action, Canada’s National Day of Remembrance is observed by those who share a commitment to end violence against women.\n\nAs well as commemorating the 14 young women whose lives ended in an act of gender-based violence that shocked the nation, December 6th represents an opportunity for Canadians to reflect on the phenomenon of violence against women in our society. It is also an opportunity to consider the women and girls for whom violence is a daily reality, and to remember those who have died as a result of gender-based violence. It is a day on which communities like BCIT can consider concrete actions to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls.\nSo on December 6th, please take a moment to stop by the memorial on your campus to remember the students and staff members of l’École Polytechnique  who were forced to leave legacies far removed from the ones they were working so hard toward.\n\nGeneviève Bergeron, Hélène Colgan, Nathalie Croteau, Barbara Daigneault, Anne-Marie Edward, Maud Haviernick, Maryse Laganière, Maryse Leclair, Anne-Marie Lemay, Sonia Pelletier, Michèle Richard, Annie St-Arneault, Annie Turcotte, and Barbara Klucznik-Widajewicz","name":"White Rose","place":{"name":"BCITSA","location":{"city":"Burnaby","country":"Canada","latitude":49.251290888603,"longitude":-123.00204802783,"state":"BC","street":"3700 Willingdon Avenue","zip":"V5G 3H2"},"id":"117426018300111"},"start_time":"2013-12-06T00:00:00-0800","id":"746696248677446"},{"description":"Our festive 3rd annual Under the Tree Christmas Fair boasts several unique vendors with all sorts of Christmas goodies and gifts for you to check out.

Simply put, this will resemble a Tourism Trade Fair electric with character, humour and oodles of national pride.  A host of countries will be represented at the 15-20 booths scattered around the hall and staffed by students eager to show off their homeland – through art, costume, food and anything they can think of to make their country the most inviting destination on Earth!  For example, Team Germany, donning lederhosen and green felt hats show us soccer skills while handing out schnitzel snacks…. Or Team Japan playing Hello Kitty games while wearing kimonos and handing out sushi…).  One of these teams will win ski passes for Most Creative Booth.  The BCIT departments responsible for bringing these students to Canada will also be on hand, promoting their programs.   And we are thrilled to announce the event will kick off with a musical introduction performed by an elder from BCIT’s Aboriginal Services.","name":"World Showcase Showdown","place":{"name":"BCITSA","location":{"city":"Burnaby","country":"Canada","latitude":49.251290888603,"longitude":-123.00204802783,"state":"BC","street":"3700 Willingdon Avenue","zip":"V5G 3H2"},"id":"117426018300111"},"start_time":"2012-11-16T11:00:00-0800","id":"118126941670565"},{"end_time":"2012-11-11T18:30:00-0800","name":"Remembrance Day","start_time":"2012-11-11T15:30:00-0800","id":"918063738236242"},{"description":"The BCITSA would like to invite students to drop by our Zen Lounge, taking place in the Great Hall on Tuesday November 6 2012. \n\nTake a quick break between your projects and classes and treat yourself to a complimentary relaxation session.

Drop-ins welcome.\n \n\nMonday April 16 – Traditional Sweat Lodge (3:00pm – 6:00pm, loggers sports field next to SE30 off of Wayburne Drive)\nIn Aboriginal culture, the sweat lodge empowers the natural elements of our being with the four elements of water, air, fire, and earth. Each element brings a quality of balance to our lives. As you participate in the ceremony, you are purified with breathing, meditating, and in the sharing of words, prayers, songs, and storytelling. A lodge ceremony is a gentle and caring approach to the cleansing of your mind, body, and spirit. Through the experience, your body is cleansed of the toxins within your body, which aids in the de-stressing of your mental, emotional, physical and spiritual well-being.\nAs part of the Speak UP Speak OUT campaign, participation is open to all BCIT students and staff, although priority will be given to students for this lodge ceremony.\n Pre-registration required - or contact Karl at 604.456.1161 / advocate@bcitsa.ca for more info.\nTo learn more about additional upcoming Traditional Sweat Lodge ceremonies at BCIT, please visit http://www.bcit.ca/aboriginal/sweatlodgecerem.shtml\n \nTuesday April 17 & Wednesday April 18: Zen Lounge, SE2, Great Hall \n The ever popular Zen Lounge is back, with a great line up of FREE wellness services available to students on Tuesday April 17 and Wednesday April 18 between 11:00am – 2:00pm in the Great Hall.
